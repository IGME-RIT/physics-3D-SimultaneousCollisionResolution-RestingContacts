Github Issues Thread on Complementary Problem solvers (LCPs, MCPs, MLCPs, etc)
https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/1772
A long discussion on various solvers for Complementary Problems. Geometric Tool's implementation of
Lemke's algorithm was enough for this use case, but this source lists quite a few more solvers.
